**Frontend Acknx** is a React-based application that integrates various components, modals, and charting libraries like **Chart.js** and **Recharts**. It leverages **Bootstrap** for responsive design and **React Router** for client-side routing, alongside **React-Bootstrap** for seamless Bootstrap component integration in React. To get started, ensure you have **Node.js (v14 or later)** and **npm** (or **Yarn**) installed. Clone the repository using `git clone https://github.com/Akash-Dhavan/frontend-acknx.git`, navigate into the project directory with `cd frontend-acknx`, and install dependencies using `npm install` or `yarn install`. To run the app in development mode, use `npm start` or `yarn start`, which will launch the app in your browser at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). For production, create a build with `npm run build` or `yarn build`, which outputs to the `build` folder. Tests can be run using `npm test` or `yarn test`. If you need to customize the app’s configuration, you can eject it using `npm run eject` or `yarn eject`—note that this is a one-way operation. Learn more about React and its features in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started) and the [React documentation](https://reactjs.org/).
